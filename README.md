# laravel_testtask_oct_2021

Please create a simple app with api endpoints that enables list/create/delete/update operations for one or more of the resources.

At a minimum, incorporate:
- Usage of each operation (CRUD) (api endpoints)
- A request for filtering one of the resources (e.g. by title, by date etc...)

Please use Laravel to accomplish this.
We are looking for a sense of your coding style. 
This is an open-ended task that you could take in many directions and that could go on forever. 
So, for functionality that you would add with more time, feel free to add comments letting us know.
